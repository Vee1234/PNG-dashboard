## Island Dashboard 
The goal of this assignment is to scope, design, implement and document a data dashboard for an island that addresses the key challenges of said island. The design of the dashboard and its functionality should come from the student; however, you will be introduced to the following tools throughout the course and it is suggested you use one of these: 
- *Gradio*
- *Streamlit*
- *Panel*
- *iPyWidget*
- *Dash* 

Other libraries may be used with instructor permission.

Students should use version control for this assignment, both to demonstrate good practice, to demonstrate authorship and to prevent any loss of code or work. You will be provided a repository for your final project on the Queen Mary Enterprise GitHub server. Commit regularly – a branch will be duplicated from the main branch at the deadline above. If you are unable to submit via GitHub, there will be a backup submission point on QM Plus. If you submit this way, please zip your folder and submit. Ensure you include the .git subfolder - just downloading from the GitHub page will not have this by default. Your application must include the code to make the notebook work in either .py  or .ipynb and all requirements, either in a *requirements.txt* file or *pyproject.toml* file. Assets can be included in the ZIP file – it is also possible to use a bash script command to retrieve these.  

*Please replace this readme file with project documentation.*

## Introduction, Scope and Context (30%) 
You should set the scope of the dashboard, discussing any datasets or databases you will be using (provenance - where they came from, how they came to be collected) and any work needed to get the data in a usable format (cleaning) or to store it before analysis (use of databases, application programming interfaces or data stored in various file formats). You may use any responsibly-sourced data for this project; it is also possible to use synthetic (i.e. fake) data if appropriate, though this may affect the following section. It is worth looking for similar projects in your area, both to provide context and to give you ideas for the analysis and implementation. You should discuss and justify your choice of libraries and tools.
| **Area**                              | **Current Description**                                                                                        | **Examples**                   | **Gaps Identified**                                                                                                                                               | **How This Project Fills the Gap / User Impact**                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Analytical Depth**                  | Most anthropological and linguistic dashboards are descriptive and focus on historical data (“what happened”). | D-Place, Glottolog, Ethnologue | No explanation of *why* linguistic patterns emerged. No predictive or forward-looking insights. No ability to explore alternative historical or future scenarios. | Introduces **predictive modelling** of language evolution. Enables **what-if simulations** (e.g. changing geography, trade, isolation, infrastructure). Helps users understand causal mechanisms and future trajectories, supporting both research and conservation planning. |
| **User Interaction & Exploration**    | User-driven exploration is limited to browsing language families and phylogenies.                              | Glottolog                      | Users cannot explore counterfactuals or simulate future evolution under changing parameters.                                                                      | Interactive controls allow users to modify environmental and social variables and **visualise their impact** on language divergence and convergence.                                                                                                                          |
| **Language Catalogues & Phylogenies** | Authoritative language lists with family trees, bibliographic info, endangerment status, and coordinates.      | Glottolog                      | No built-in statistical analysis. No linking of linguistic data to environmental variables (altitude, forests, coastlines, isolation).                            | Integrates **environmental datasets** (altitude, terrain, coastlines, roads). Enables hypothesis testing such as whether isolation or environment correlates with linguistic diversity.                                                                                       |
| **Contact & Isolation Analysis**      | Languages are displayed independently within families.                                                         | Glottolog                      | No measure of isolation or contact hotspots. No insight into where inter-group contact occurred or its linguistic consequences.                                   | Visualises **contact hotspots** using lexical similarity. Helps explain deviations from phylogenetic expectations and shared cultural or linguistic traits.                                                                                                                   |
| **Lexical Distance Data**             | Lexical similarity is available numerically (e.g. Levenshtein distance matrices).                              | ASJP                           | No spatial visualisation of lexical distance. Geography and lexical similarity are not connected visually.                                                        | Map-based visualisation with **weighted connections** between languages. Users can select a language and view its closest lexical neighbours, revealing historical interaction patterns.                                                                                      |
| **Noise & Interpretability**          | Lexical distances are presented in dense matrices.                                                             | ASJP                           | High noise makes interpretation difficult. No thresholds or prioritisation of meaningful relationships.                                                           | Threshold-based filtering shows only the most relevant relationships, with colour-coded weights. Numerical values remain accessible for deeper analysis.                                                                                                                      |
| **Linguistic Feature Comparison**     | Individual linguistic features are available per language (e.g. word order, phoneme inventory).                | WALS, Glottolog                | No visualisation of how features evolve across a language family or diverge geographically.                                                                       | Enables **trait evolution analysis** across families, allowing comparison of feature changes (e.g. word order differences within Indo-European).                                                                                                                              |
| **Data Fragmentation**                | Linguistic features are stored across multiple databases.                                                      | WALS, Glottolog                | No unified platform for combined analysis. High barrier to cross-database research.                                                                               | Provides a **single analytical interface** aggregating multiple datasets, reducing friction and enabling richer insights.                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Advanced Filtering**                | Filtering is basic or non-existent.                                                                            | WALS, Glottolog                | Cannot perform multi-variable queries linking environment, typology, and isolation.                                                                               | Multi-layered filters (e.g. *high altitude + agglutinative morphology + lexical isolation*) enable targeted hypothesis exploration.                                                                                                                                           |
| **Geographical Visualisation**        | Languages shown as points on a map, coloured by vitality.                                                      | WALS, Glottolog                | No vitality legend. Speaker numbers not displayed. Language areas undefined.                                                                                      | Adds legends, speaker counts, and **Voronoi-based language areas** to better represent linguistic territories and uncertainty.                                                                                                                                                |

## Methodology and Data Analysis (30%) 
You should talk about and demonstrate your analysis methods and approaches to visualisation here. While the quality of data available will depend on your project, you should be able to demonstrate statistics at the level of collections and subcollections. You should consider what types of visualisations will best convey your insights, and how these will be accessible to your audience. You should also ensure your work is reproducible and that algorithms or formulas used for calculations are documented. 
## Design and Implementation (30%) 
You should show how you constructed the dashboard, demonstrating both the visual and code design. A dashboard implies either interactivity or up-to-date data; ideally, you should include both. This means your dashboard should be interactive and responsive, accommodating different types of users. It should also be updatable, should new data be available. Version control should be used to track the development of new features against documented requirements. You should show knowledge of the classes and methods of libraries used, extending functionality where appropriate. 
## Recommendation, Reflection and Conclusions (10%) 
While this part alone is worth the least number of marks, this is critical for showing the learning that occurred during your work on the assignment, and effective completion of this section will allow you to get more marks in earlier sections. You should link your work to relevant knowledge, skills and behaviour from the apprenticeship, and ensure the marker has everything they need to use and evaluate your code.
