## Island Dashboard 
The goal of this assignment is to scope, design, implement and document a data dashboard for an island that addresses the key challenges of said island. The design of the dashboard and its functionality should come from the student; however, you will be introduced to the following tools throughout the course and it is suggested you use one of these: 
- *Gradio*
- *Streamlit*
- *Panel*
- *iPyWidget*
- *Dash* 

Other libraries may be used with instructor permission.

Students should use version control for this assignment, both to demonstrate good practice, to demonstrate authorship and to prevent any loss of code or work. You will be provided a repository for your final project on the Queen Mary Enterprise GitHub server. Commit regularly – a branch will be duplicated from the main branch at the deadline above. If you are unable to submit via GitHub, there will be a backup submission point on QM Plus. If you submit this way, please zip your folder and submit. Ensure you include the .git subfolder - just downloading from the GitHub page will not have this by default. Your application must include the code to make the notebook work in either .py  or .ipynb and all requirements, either in a *requirements.txt* file or *pyproject.toml* file. Assets can be included in the ZIP file – it is also possible to use a bash script command to retrieve these.  

*Please replace this readme file with project documentation.*

## Introduction, Scope and Context (30%) 
You should set the scope of the dashboard, discussing any datasets or databases you will be using (provenance - where they came from, how they came to be collected) and any work needed to get the data in a usable format (cleaning) or to store it before analysis (use of databases, application programming interfaces or data stored in various file formats). You may use any responsibly-sourced data for this project; it is also possible to use synthetic (i.e. fake) data if appropriate, though this may affect the following section. It is worth looking for similar projects in your area, both to provide context and to give you ideas for the analysis and implementation. You should discuss and justify your choice of libraries and tools.
### Introduction
With over 800 languages spoken by a population of just over 10 million people, Papua New Guinea is the most linguistically rich country in the world. I built a Streamlit-powered data dashboard to enable interactive exploration of language distribution and speaker populations across Papua New Guinea through three complementary visualisations. First, a geographic map displays the epicentres of individual languages, colour-coded by number of speakers. Interactive tooltips provide language-specific metadata, and users can filter by speaker population or search for individual languages. Second, a choropleth map shows the number of distinct languages spoken within each administrative province, with hover-based interaction revealing provincial counts. Third, a logarithmically scaled bar chart presents speaker populations for all languages, with extinct languages visually distinguished. The underlying dataset was built on an established data set, wth significant supplementation from data scraping and derived data. Single-responsibility classes encapsulate methods, with some classes having their own class variables.

### Gap Analysis
The problem addressed by this dashboard was defined through a review of existing linguistic visualisation tools and databases, focusing on their analytical scope, the combinations of data presented and the way that the data is presented. This analysis revealed a consistent emphasis on descriptive representation, with gaps in predictive insights, speaker number- geographical visualisations and national-regional language statistics offerings. The table below outlines a few of the different categories I analysed for gaps: 
| **Dimension**                      | **Current Practice**                                          | **Representative Systems**     | **Limitation**                                                               | **Contribution of This Work**                                                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Analytical Orientation**         | Descriptive visualisation of observed linguistic data.        | D-Place, Glottolog, Ethnologue | Focuses on documentation rather than explanation or prediction.              | Introduces explanatory and predictive models of language evolution.                |
| **Geographical Representation**    | Point-based language markers.                                 | WALS, Glottolog                | Speaker populations and spatial extent are not represented. **No single map with overlayed language statistics.**  **Limited investigation of the distribution of languages at a national or regional level**         | Incorporates speaker counts, explicit legends, and inferred language areas.        |
| **Temporal Modelling**             | Static or historical representations.                         | Glottolog                      | No capacity for forward projection or counterfactual analysis.               | Enables simulation of future and alternative evolutionary trajectories.            |
| **Environmental Integration**      | Linguistic data visualised independently of physical context. | Glottolog                      | Environmental drivers of linguistic change remain unexamined.                | Integrates geospatial and environmental variables for correlation analysis.        |
| **Linguistic Feature Dynamics**    | Linguistic features listed per language.                      | WALS, Glottolog                | Feature evolution across families and regions is not analysed.               | Enables comparative analysis of typological trait evolution.                       |

This research informed my problem definition; I decided to target the gaps in **Geographical Representation**

Two existing projects in this area are Glottolog, an online bibliography and classification for the world's languages, and the Endangered Languages Project. Both projects offer map-based language visualisations, but do not allow the user to remain in the map context whilst viewing speaker number. Furthermore, these systems do not provide data or visualisations at administrative levels, limiting insight into language hotspots and the effects of geographic isolation on language density.

My dashboard combines geographical information with speaker and language numbers and presents how language distribution varies by region.


### Provenance
Provenance analysis aided me to determine which resources were most suitable for my project and optimise use of them to maximise both credibility and coverage.

## Data Scraping 
As Ethnologue datasets are located behind a paywall, I decided to scrape the datasets from urls provided. 
![alt text](<images/Screenshot 2026-01-12 at 18.05.23.png>)
## Methodology and Data Analysis (30%) 
You should talk about and demonstrate your analysis methods and approaches to visualisation here. While the quality of data available will depend on your project, you should be able to demonstrate statistics at the level of collections and subcollections. You should consider what types of visualisations will best convey your insights, and how these will be accessible to your audience. You should also ensure your work is reproducible and that algorithms or formulas used for calculations are documented. 
## Design and Implementation (30%) 
You should show how you constructed the dashboard, demonstrating both the visual and code design. A dashboard implies either interactivity or up-to-date data; ideally, you should include both. This means your dashboard should be interactive and responsive, accommodating different types of users. It should also be updatable, should new data be available. Version control should be used to track the development of new features against documented requirements. You should show knowledge of the classes and methods of libraries used, extending functionality where appropriate. 
## Recommendation, Reflection and Conclusions (10%) 
While this part alone is worth the least number of marks, this is critical for showing the learning that occurred during your work on the assignment, and effective completion of this section will allow you to get more marks in earlier sections. You should link your work to relevant knowledge, skills and behaviour from the apprenticeship, and ensure the marker has everything they need to use and evaluate your code.
